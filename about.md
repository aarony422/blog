Hi! My name is Aaron and I am a recent graduate from Oberlin College with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science. As an aspiring software developer, I'd like to use a blog to keep a record of what I am learning over time.

In my spare time, I like to cook, play tennis and the violin, and spend time with friends and family.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
