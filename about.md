Hi! My name is Aaron Young and I am a recent graduate from Oberlin College with a major in Computer Science. One of many things I have learned from college is that the world of CS is like a gigantic creature; it is fascinating, complex, intimidating, and sometimes difficult to work with.

As an aspiring software developer, I have reached out to the online CS community countless times for help on anything (and EVERYTHING) that could go wrong, and the world of CS always seems a little less daunting.

The purpose of this blog is really for me to keep a record of what I am learning over time, and hopefully helping somebody along the way.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
