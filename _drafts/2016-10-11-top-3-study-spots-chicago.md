If you are like me who could never concentrate and be productive at home, then
you'll understand the need for good coffeeshops that have the following qualities
(in the order of importance):

* Free and fast Wifi
* Plenty of personal seating and table space
* Outlets
* Easy to get to
* Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere for people who want to sit and work for 4-6 hours straight
* Reasonably priced drinks
* Low traffic / Quiet, but not silent
* Ample lighting

While not every coffeeshop is perfect, here are my current favorite study spots
in Chicago that I frequent quite a lot:

## 1. Jackalope Coffee & Tea House

| Wifi      | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> | 54.74 Mbps DL / 8.66 Mbps UL |
| Seating      | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>      |   50+ seats |
| Outlets | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>      | All seats are within reach of an outlet |
| Transportation | <i class="fa fa-meh-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>      | Of course this depends on where you live, but it's not very close to a train station. There is, however, a bus that can take you right in front the shop. |
| Atmosphere | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>      | A lot of people sit and work here for extended periods of time, so you'll feel right at home!   |
| Price | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>     | My favorite drink here is the Matcha Smoothie w/ whipped cream |
| Volume / Lighting / Traffic | <i class="fa fa-meh-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> | This is a nice quiet area, and does not get a lot of traffic. While the music is for the most part good, sometimes they do play some rock n' roll which can become annoying. The store isn't very well lit, so it might be an issue if you're working on paper or reading a book. |

## 2. Next Door Cafe

| Wifi      | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> | 39.1 Mbps DL / 3.27 UL |
| Seating      | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>      |   60+ seats. Large open space, with private cubicles |
| Outlets | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>      | Plenty of outlets and extension cords |
| Transportation | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>      | In a very nice neighborhood with lots of businesses and public transportation. |
| Atmosphere | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>      | This is a community space specifically for freelancers and people who work from home. That means people come here to get serious work done, which is awesome! This is probably the ideal study spot, with a young / startup vibe.|
| Price | <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>     | They have very interesting seasonal drinks |
| Volume / Lighting / Traffic | <i class="fa fa-smile-o"  aria-hidden="true"></i> | This place does get a little crowded around the late afternoon, and often times have speakers and workshops around 6:30pm. Medium level pop songs that keep you motivated. The space is very well lit.|
