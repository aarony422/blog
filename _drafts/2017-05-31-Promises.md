Motivation: what are promises and why should I care?
callback: when this is done, execute this code
promises serve the same purpose, but more powerful, because they are composable
This means we can use promises to maintain callbacks

promises in js are like promises in real life...
A promise is an object that represents an action that hasn't finished yet. Placeholder for the result of some asyc operation. We register callbacks in the promise for when the action completes. Resolve when the action was successful, and reject, when it is not.

Once the action has been completed, we can use whatever data from that action and do something with it in the then() function, which is called when the action is completed.

If the action fails, we can run catch().

simple example


What if I needed to make more than one asyc actions? That's where promises become more powerful than callbacks.

In the then() of first promise, we can simply return another promise.

More complex example with composition

Creating a sequence:
var sequence = Promise.resolve()
forEach obj, return a promise with a .then to process data
